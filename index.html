        <p>High in dense bamboo forests in the misty, rainy mountains of southwestern China lives one of the world's rarest mammals: the giant panda, also called the panda bear. 
            Only about 1,500 of these black-and-white relatives of bears survive in the wild. The panda, with its distinctive black and white coat, is adored by the world and considered a national treasure in China. This bear also has a special significance for WWF because it has been their logo since founding in 1961.
            Pandas' molars are very broad and flat. 
            Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo shoots and leaves. Occasionally they eat other vegetation, fish, or small animals, but bamboo accounts for 99 percent of their diets. 
            The shape of the teeth helps the animals crush the bamboo shoots, leaves, and stems that they eat. They can chomp on bamboo up to one-and-a-half inches thick. 
            To get the bamboo to their mouths, they hold the stems with their front paws, which have enlarged wrist bones that act as thumbs for gripping. 
            Pandas eat fast, they eat a lot, and they spend about 12 hours a day doing it. The reason: They digest only about a fifth of what they eat. Overall, bamboo is not very nutritious.
            A panda should have at least two bamboo species where it lives, or it will starve.  A scarcity in bamboo threatens the already limited panda population.</p>

        <p>An adult female panda weighs 200-300 pounds. A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults. 
            These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk. Sometimes male pandas relax by doing handstands against trees.
            Pandas are shy; they don't venture into areas where people live. This restricts pandas to very limited areas.</p>

     <h2>10 interesting facts about Pandas:</h2>
     
     <ol>
        <li>
        <b>They have great camouflage for their environment. </b> <br>
            The giant panda's distinct black-and-white markings have two functions: camouflage and communication.  Most of the panda - its face, neck, belly, rump - is white to help it hide in snowy habitats. The arms and legs are black, helping it to hide in shade.
        </li>
        
        <li> 
            <b>Their eyes are different to normal bears.</b> <br>    
        Like domestic cats, giant pandas have vertical slits for pupils.
        </li>

        <li>
            <b>Cubs are well protected in their first months.</b> <br>
            Mother pandas keep contact with their cub nearly 100% of the time during their first month - with the cub resting on her front and remaining covered by her paw, arm or head.
        </li> 
        <li>
            <b>Courageous cubs!</b> <br>
            At 5 months old, giant pandas learn how to climb - sometimes practicing by climbing on their mum.
        </li> 
        <li>
            <b>A helping hand.</b> <br>
            They have an extended wrist bone that they use like a thumb to help them grip food.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>They spend a lot of their day eating.</b> <br>
            Giant pandas spend 10-16 hours a day feeding, mainly on bamboo.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Bamboo is critical to their diet.</b> <br>
            Pandas need at least 2 different bamboo species in their range to avoid starvation
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>But they do occasionally eat something other than bamboo.</b> <br>
            Although pandas are 99% vegetarian their digestive system is typical of a carnivore. For the 1% of their diet that isn't bamboo, pandas eat eggs, small animals, carrion, and forage in farmland for pumpkin, kidney beans, wheat and domestic pig food.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Pandas sometimes do handstands when they wee!</b> <br>
            Sometimes, to mark their scent, panda's climb a tree backwards with their hindfeet until they're in a full handstand upside down - enabling them to leave their scent higher up.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>They like to keep it regular.</b> <br>
            On average, pandas poo 40 times a day.
        </li>
